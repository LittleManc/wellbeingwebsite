# wellbeingwebsite
A side project in a team of three to create a basic wellbeing website.

Here is the brief we were given:

‘Must have’

• A minimum of 2 HTML web pages and one external CSS file
• Consistent navbar on all pages
• Styled well
• All links working
• Basic user interaction (Ex: hover, submit form, Action on click)
‘Nice to have’

• All of the ‘Must Have criteria’ +
• Mobile responsive website
• Effective use of classes and IDs
• JavaScript used to enable user interaction*

We wanted to focus on something we were interested in but also felt was managable as this was our first attempt at a website.
